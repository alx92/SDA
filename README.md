# SDA
Website :rocket: created for final SDA project - Spring Boot + Angular 10 + MySQL

The project is built using REST API with Spring Boot and using Nasa's open API's to get space imagery and information (JSON) to display in a responsive frontend with Angular and Bootstrap.
Apart from the home tab, it has 3 main modules: 
●	Astronomic Picture of the Day (APOD) - This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata and displays it to the user.
●	Near Earth Objects (NeoWs) - REST-ful web service for near earth asteroid information based on their closest approach date to Earth.
●	InSight (Mars Weather Service API) - NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) near Mars’ equator. Summaries of these data are available on the website for the user to view.
